# v0.5.1

## Fixed
- Pipe install crash: Removed indirect variable expansion (`${!_v}`) that caused `bash: line 45: !_v: unbound variable` under `set -u` during curl | bash usage. Replaced with direct safe initializers.

## Quality
- Added install smoke GitHub Action (`install-smoke.yml`) to exercise curl | bash path in a clean directory.

## Upgrade Notes
- No action required for existing bootstrapped repos. Only affects new installations.

## Thanks
- Report + validation workflow improvements.
