# Roadmap

This file is the source of truth for what to build next. Copilot and humans should both use it.

How to use
- Humans: Edit items below. Keep acceptance criteria concise and concrete.
- Copilot: Pick the top item under “Now” (or the first in “Next” if “Now” is empty). Work in small, end-to-end increments and update this file with status and PR links.

Status buckets
- Now: Highest priority. Take one small slice at a time.
- Next: Upcoming work, not yet started.
- Later: Nice-to-have or blocked items.
- Done: Completed items with links to PRs.

## Now
- [ ] Feature/Task: Short, imperative title
  - Why: One sentence on value/impact
  - Acceptance:
    - [ ] Criterion 1
    - [ ] Criterion 2
  - Tech notes: Key constraints, file pointers, or follow-ups (optional)
  - Tests: What should be covered by tests (optional)

## Next
- [ ] Example: Improve error handling in engine-runner
  - Acceptance:
    - [ ] Return structured error codes
    - [ ] Add integration test covering parity:local failure path

## Later
- [ ] Example: Migrate docs to Docusaurus v3

## Done
- [ ] (autofilled by humans/Copilot when items complete; include PR URL)
